This program has been written by Arthur Milchior as part of his Computer Science PhD at University Paris Diderot.
It can be compiled with 
occamlbuild main.native

You can with this code:
Take a FO[<,mod] formula and generate the minimal automaton that accepts it,
Read a list of automaton in the file input, reading natural numbers or integers and check if it is definable with quantifier-free formula with some subset of the predicate [+N, =N, <, mod]
Generate a formula describing the set accepted by the automaton.
